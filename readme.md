## Introduction

In this repository, we have implemented a range of features to make your home smarter and more efficient. The project includes various IoT devices and sensors that can be controlled and monitored through a central system. This system can be accessed and controlled remotely, making it easy to manage your home's devices and services from anywhere.

## Features

- **Remote Control:** Control smart devices in your home from your smartphone or computer, no matter where you are.
- **Home Automation:** Set up automation rules for your devices to make your home more efficient.
- **Data Monitoring:** Collect and visualize data from sensors around your home.
- **Security:** Enhance the security of your home by integrating IoT-based security systems.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer for acting as a central controller.
- IoT devices such as smart plugs, lights, sensors, etc.
- Familiarity with programming languages like Python.
- Basic understanding of IoT protocols and networking.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi or central controller.

```bash
